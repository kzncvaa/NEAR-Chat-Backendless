This is a template for developing JS-based API Services. Once you download and unzip the file, open a command prompt (Terminal) window, change to the project's root directory and run:
```
npm install
```

After all the npm modules are installed, run the following command to start a local copy of CodeRunner in the debug mode and then navigate to **Business Logic** in Backendless Console to see the sample API Service in action:
```
npm run debug
```
